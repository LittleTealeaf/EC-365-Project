  The question I would like to answer is how working with different languages affects your yearly salary. I think this is an interesting question because it might bring to light languages that not many people use, and may have a significant impact on salary.

  The data that I will be using is the yearly StackOverflow developer survey.
  \url{https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/}. Every year, StackOverflow asks their uses to fill out a developer survey, asking questions such as what languages people use, how often they search StackOverflow, etc. The developer survey for 2022 has around 72,000 results, and includes what appears to be enough variables that I can use in my analysis.
